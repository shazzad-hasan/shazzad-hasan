## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I am a deep learning enthusiast. I love to learn from first principles, write efficient code, and train neural networks on large datasets.
- ğŸ”­ My research spans the areas of computer vision and deep learning.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently working on Zero-Shot Learning and its variants e.g., Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, Few-Shot Learning, and Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning.
