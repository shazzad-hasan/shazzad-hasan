## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a deep learning enthusiast. I love to learn from first principles, write efficient code, and train neural networks on large datasets. 

- ðŸ”­ My research spans the areas of computer vision and deep learning. In particular, I'm interested in Zero-Shot Learning with a view toward designing models that can        correlate multi-model information about the seen objects to reason about the unseen ones.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on Generalized Zero-Shot Learning and Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning.
