## Hi there 👋

I am a deep learning enthusiast. I love to learn from first principles, write efficient code, and train neural networks on large datasets.
- 🔭 My research spans the areas of computer vision and deep learning.
- 🌱 I'm currently working on Zero-Shot Learning and its variants e.g., Generalized Zero-Shot Learning, Incremental Zero-Shot Learning, Few-Shot Learning, Generalized Few-Shot Learning, and Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning.
