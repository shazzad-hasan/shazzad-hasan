## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a deep learning enthusiast. I love to learn from first principles, write efficient code, and train neural networks on large datasets.
- ðŸ”­ My research spans the areas of computer vision and deep learning.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on few-shot class incremental learning, more specifically on how a model learns new concepts gradually where only 
      a few examples per concept are available to the learner.
